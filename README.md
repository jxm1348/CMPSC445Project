Brief Description: This project aims to leverage the power of short long-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict future electric vehicle (EV) sales. The transition to electric mobility is gaining momentum worldwide, making accurate sales predictions crucial for stakeholders, including manufacturers,  policymakers, and investors. LSTM networks are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for forecasting time-series like EV sales.
